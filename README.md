This notebook was prepared for the sixth project of the Post Graduate Program in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Business Applications from the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas. The data was provided in a .csv file.

The focus of this project was using machine learning algorithms for an unsupervised learning problem. In this case “All Life Bank”, wishes to identify segments in an existing customer base, based on their average credit limit, total credit cards and preferred method of contacting the bank.

I use both K-means clustering and Hierarchical clustering techniques to segment the data. Using Silhouette Scores and Cophenetic Coefficient to QC the clusters.

While this project was done as part of a school project. I believe it indicates the quality of work that I’m capable of in real-world applications. I was the top student in my cohort with a final course weighted average of 99.39%.
